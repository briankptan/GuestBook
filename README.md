## Overview
### Description
This application acts as a digital guestbook for event such as weddings, baby showers, birthday parties and more.
Users will be able to either create an event or sign up for an event. Within these events, users can upload photos,
videos, and text that will be displayed to the event's timeline.

### App Evaluation
- **Category:** Social Media
- **Mobile:** Mobile allows for convenient use of this app. Users will be able to use the camera to take pictures
	      of the event they are at as well as easily upload any photos/videos from their phone. They can also use
	      the map feature to "tag" locations.
- **Story:** Allows for a digitalized, mobile, and compact guestbook that can be easily accessed from anywhere by the
             desired party.
- **Market:** Any person hosting an event who wishes to keep a guestbook. Especially marketed towards weddings and 
              baby showers.
- **Habit:** Event hosts can easily set this up for their events and guests can access the events at any time to upoad content.
- **Scope:** V1 would allow users to create an account and create an event with uploading capabilities. V2 would allow for users to
             see the event timelines. V3 would allow for multiple event timelines and capabilities for multiple users to "sign into" an event.
